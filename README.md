Week 3, day 2, homework (sinatra)

These were our specs:
Create a sinatra app which has the follwing routes:

1. '/' - responds HTML with information about you e.g. name & bio
2. Part A:

'/address' responds with this address in JSON:
	{
		address: '3 ARGYLE HOUSE',
		building: 'CODEBASE'
		postcode: 'e13 zqf',
		phone: '0131558030'
	}
	
Part B:

Write and test-drive a WordFormatter class with a method to format the postcode to upcase which should then be used in your 'address' route.

3. Part A:

Create a method to camelcase strings e.g. 'code clan' should become "CodeClan"

Part B:

Create a route with a dynamic path so your app can CamelCase text. Send the code back in HTML or JSON

4. Add a stylesheet and add a few custom styles of your choice.
